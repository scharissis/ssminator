# SSMinator

Makes using AWS SSM simpler.
This is a very early iteration; I do not recommend using this package as of yet.

## Features
- Simpler return structs (without pointers)

## Features Under Consideration
- Converting async calls to sync, or providing sync variants

## CLI API
```
cmd
 - run
 - check
```

## TODO
- Decide on high-level cli api
- Decide on high-level pkg api
- Document missing methods we wish to expose
- Tests
